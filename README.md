# Purchasing and accessing commercial data through Sentinel Hub

Access to commercial high-resolution data complements Digital Earth Africa's free and open Earth observation data. This repository contains notebooks that can be used to query, purchase, and access commercial satellite data through the [Sentinel Hub](https://www.sentinel-hub.com/) API.

The `odc-sh` Python package is used and should be installed first, e.g. using pip:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/sentinel-hub/odc-sh.git
```

More information on how to use `odc-sh` and the configurations available can be found from https://github.com/sentinel-hub/odc-sh.
